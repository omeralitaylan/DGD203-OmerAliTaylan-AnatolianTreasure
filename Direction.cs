/*
 I asked you a question about the use of AI in the classroom. Before asking that question, I had made another much more detailed game with AI and another code structure, but after I asked you the question, I changed my mind and decided to cancel this game and create something with your structure.

I built the project on the code structure you gave. After some features I added to the game, I encountered errors and edited the project with Claude AI to fix these errors.
